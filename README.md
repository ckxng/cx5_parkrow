cx5_parkrow
===========

This is the parkrow website 3.x release.  We moved from Symfony to ExpressJS in
order to reduce the development complexity.  Features are added only as they
are needed, and this keeps everything very slim.

This code is uploaded for the benefit of the community, who may use it however
they see fit according to the Simplified BSD License.

(www.parkrow.net no longer uses this source code and has moved to Google Apps)

Status
======

This software is ABANDONED.

This software was created for Park Row Church of Christ.  It lacks documentation 
and may be difficult to reuse.  I do not have any interest in continuing work 
on this project, at this time.
